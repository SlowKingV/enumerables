# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

> In this project, we have to implement our own version of Ruby‚Äôs enumerable methods.


## Built With

- Ruby.
- VSCode

## Getting Started

*You can either clone or download the ruby files (.rb). Make sure that ***spec/*** directory is in the same folder as ***enumerables.rb****


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine. [Check this link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby
- [Optional] To run tests you need to install RSpec. Check out the [RSpec Homepage](https://rspec.info/) for instructions on installing and using it.

### Run tests
- Use the command `$ rspec` to run the tests inside `spec/` directory which includes several tests for all the methods and its explanation.
- To write your custom test cases in a different file, just make sure your file is inside the `/spec` folder and starts with `require './enumerables.rb'`.
- To add custom test cases to the original file, make sure you add them inside the right `context '[method]' do` block where `[method]` is the method you want to test. Use the `it '...' do` block to define a new test case and add your description of it inside. Use a single `it` block for each test case.
