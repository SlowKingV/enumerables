# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

> In this project, we have to implement our own version of Ruby‚Äôs enumerable methods.


## Built With

- Ruby.
- VSCode

## Demo

You can try the code here:
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SlowKingV/enumerables)](https://repl.it/github/SlowKingV/enumerables)


## Getting Started

*You can either clone or download the ruby files (.rb). Make sure that ***test_cases.rb*** is in the same folder as ***enumerables.rb****


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine. ([Check this link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Run tests
- The file `test_cases.rb` includes several tests for all the methods and each one of them has its expected output inside a comment at the end of line.
- To write your custom test cases in a different file, just make sure your file starts with `require "./enumerables.rb"`, if your file is in a different location, make sure to add its relative or absolute path to this property.
